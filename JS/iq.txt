 html5 & css
 ---------
 HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics on a web page using javascript
 
 inline,block level elements in html5
  an inline element does not cause a line break (start on a new line) 
  A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width of a page, 

  positions 
	static
	relative
	fixed
	absolute
		An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned parent (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):
	sticky
 
 html5 features
	cross browee
	head,footer,body, ecttt canvas,audio,video 
	storage,grad and drop 
	nav,content,email,url 
	
	What is a Web Worker?
		When executing scripts in an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished.
		A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.
 
 What is the Geolocation API in HTML5?
	The HTML Geolocation API is used to get the geographical position of a user.
	(navigator.geolocation
 
 What’s one main result if you do not specify a doctype in an HTML page?
	New HTML5-specific tags will not be interpreted by the browser.
 
 svg,canvas
	SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics, but <canvas> allows you to draw 2D graphics on the fly using JavaScript.
 What is a Manifest file?
	A Manifest file is a simple text file that tells the browser what to cache and what not to cache.	
	
	
 List the basic layout components of the CSS box model with a brief description for each.
	border,content,margin,padding

 JQuery
 ---------
 load 
	The load event occurs when a specified element has been loaded.
		$("img").load(function(){
		alert("Image loaded.");
		})

 ready
	$( document ).ready() will only run once the page Document Object Model (DOM) is ready for JavaScript code to execute
	
 difference  .Onload() vs ready()
	The main differences between the two are:
	Body.Onload() event will be called only after the DOM and associated resources like images got loaded, 
	but jQuery's document.ready() event will be called once the DOM is loaded i.e.,
		it wont wait for the resources like images to get loaded.

 event handling
	binding events lick click,blur,hover,live,bind 
 event bubbling vs event capturing
		Event bubbling and capturing are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM API, when an event occurs in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle for that event. The event propagation mode determines in which order the elements receive the event.
		With bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements.
		With capturing, the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements.
 
 no conflict
	Use the noConflict() method to specify a new name for the jQuery variable:
	var jq = $.noConflict();
 
	jq(document).ready(function(){
    jq("button").click(function(){
        jq("p").hide();
    });
	});
	Tip: This method is useful when other JavaScript libraries use the $ for their functions.


 What is method chaining in jQuery? Provide an example.	

	Method chaining is a feature of jQuery that allows several methods to be executed on a jQuery selection in sequence in a single code statement. 

	$( "button#play-movie" ).on( "click", playMovie )
        .css( "background-color", "orange" )
        show();
		
		
		$( "div" ).css( "width", "300px" )
		.add( "p" )
		.css( "background-color", "blue" );
		
 What is the difference between jQuery.get() and jQuery.ajax()?		
		jQuery.ajax() is the all-encompassing Ajax request method provided by jQuery. It allows for the creation of highly-customized Ajax requests, with options for how long to wait for a response, how to handle a failure, whether the request is blocking (synchronous) or non-blocking (asynchronous), what format to request for the response, and many more options.
		jQuery.get() is a shortcut method that uses jQuery.ajax() under the hood, to create an Ajax request that is typical for simple retrieval of information. Other pre-built Ajax requests are provided by jQuery, such as jQuery.post(), jQuery.getScript(), and jQuery.getJSON().
 
 What is the proper way in jQuery to remove an element from the DOM before its Promise is resolved?
	.removeData() 
	
 What’s the difference between prop() and attr()?
	The prop() method should be used to retrieve property values, e.g. DOM properties (like tagName, nodeName, defaultChecked) or your own custom made properties.
	To retrieve HTML attributes, use the attr()
	
	
	the jQuery.attr() will give the value of the first matching attribute in the original HTML file, while

 angular 1.x
 --------------
 
 1. fetch data from api
 
	.controller('AppCtrl', function($scope) {
})

.service('HttpService', function($http) {
  return {
    getPost: function() {
      // $http returns a promise, which has a then function, which also returns a promise.
      return $http.get('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
       .then(function (response) {
       // In the response, resp.data contains the result. Check the console to see all of the data returned.
       console.log('Get Post', response);
       return response.data;
      });
    }
  };
});
 
 
 2. how to bootstrap angular app
		a.
	<!doctype html>
		<html>
		<body>
		  <div id="year" ng-controller="Year">{{CurrentYear}}</div>
		  <script src="angular.js"></script>
		  <script>
		  angular.module('example', [])
		  .controller('Year', function($scope) {
			$scope.CurrentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
		  });
		  angular.bootstrap(document.getElementById('year'), ['example']);
		  </script>
		</body>
		</html>
 
	b.   angular.element(function() {
            angular.bootstrap(document, ['myApp']);
			});
			
 3.$scope and $routescope 
	$Scope, scope available in with in the controller but $rootscope scope available in global it means available in all controller
	
	set : $rootScope.currentUser = userObj;
	get : console.log($rootScope.currentUser);
	
	
 4.->ngSanitize -> Use ngSanitize to securely parse and manipulate HTML data in your application.
    ->ngcloak-> Prevent the application from flicker at page load:	
	ng-init used to initialize a variable
	
 5.providers
 
	A provider is an object with a $get() method. 
	The injector calls the $get method to create a new instance of a service. The Provider can have additional methods which would allow for configuration of the provider.
	  
	AngularJS uses $provide to register new providers.  
 6.$q 
	$q is an angular define a service. It’s same as new Promise(). But $q takes things to the next level by 
	enhancing additional feature that developers can use to perform complex tasks more simply.
	
	it has resolve,reject 
		promise.then(function(data) {
			alert(data)  
			})
	$q.defer()
	
	$q.defer() return the instance of the promise constructor.
		 Once you create a defer object there are following methods and properties that you can access from that object
		 resolve,reject,notify,promise
		   var obj = $q.defer();
		   
		   obj.promise
	$q.all()
			If a user need to send multiple request one shot,then the user can use $q.all() service.	   
	
	
	The difference between a factory and a service is that a factory injects a plain function so AngularJS will call the function 
	and a service injects a constructor. 
	
	
	7. routing 
	   $routeprovider ->provide route functionality
		.when('/home',{
		templateUrl:'url',
		controller:"name of controller",
		})

	8.diff between directive vs service
	
	9.Explain what is injector in AngularJS?
			The $injector service is responsible for determining the dependencies that a function declares and resolving those dependencies
