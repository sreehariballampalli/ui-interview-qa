Angular Installation:
---------------------
Install nodejs : It will install node js and npm (node package manager)
  node -v , npm - v
Then install Angular CLI: 
  The Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that you use to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications directly from a command shel

  npm install -g @angular CLI

  create new proj : ng new projname then ng serve
  ng generate component name/service name/ directive name // generate     component/service

  ng g m [module-name] --routing // create module with routhing 

  ng add  // help us to add modules like ng add @angular/pwa, ng add @angular/material etc

  ng build :
  ---------------
  // Compiles an Angular app into an output directory named dist/
    dist contains .js files // index.html, main.js, polyfils.js, run time.js, style.css, fav icon

    this ng build takes help of the 'webpack build tool', spme default options set in "angular.json under build section"

WebPack:
---------
  Webpack is a popular module bundler, a tool for bundling application source code in convenient chunks and for loading that code from a server into a browser.

  Webpack can preprocess and minify different non-JavaScript files such as TypeScript, SASS, and LESS files.

  Basically cli internally have webpack to build app but,wt about with out cli? in such a sitution we use webpack

  we manually create package.json and add dependencies and create folder strecure for the proj and configure web package
  webpack: expect input, output, loaders

  ng serve:
  ----------
    Build the application and start a web server.


  ng congig:
  ----------
  Retrieves or sets Angular configuration values in the angular.json file for the workspace.
  ng config <json-path> <value>

  ng deploy:
  ----------
  We can deploy the APP from CLI it self through ng deploy command,
  before that we need to configure build details in angular.json under build obj

  "deploy": {
        "builder": "@angular/fire:deploy",
        "options": {}
      }
